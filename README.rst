This is a heavily hacked, but mostly reduced version of Pygments circa 2.0.

I use it for older vesions of the Python 3 trepan debuggers (and possibly Python 2 debuggers)

The authors
-----------

The original version of Pygments is maintained by **Georg Brandl**, e-mail address *georg*\ *@*\ *python.org*.

Many lexers and fixes have been contributed by **Armin Ronacher**, the rest of
the `Pocoo <http://dev.pocoo.org/>`_ team and **Tim Hatch**. (However I, rocky have removed a number of of these. My focus is only on Python.)
